 <h1>Italy</h1>
 <div class="bd">
   <p>As the birthplace of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance, 
   it's not surprising that Italy should be so rich in masterpieces 
   of art and architecture, or that it should have more UNESCO World 
   Heritage cultural sites than any other country in the world. But Italy's top attractions for tourists are not all art and architecture; the country is blessed with lakes, mountains, and a dramatic coastline that give it outstanding natural attractions, as well. This list of top places to visit is only 
   the beginning of outstanding things to see and do in Italy.

		For travelers making their way through Italy, the Colosseum 
		is a must see. This huge Amphitheater is the largest of its 
		kind ever built by the Roman Empire and has remained a model
		for sports facilities right up to modern times. Built as a
		venue for public spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles,
		it had a wooden floor that was 83 by 48 meters. Underneath it were two stories of tunnels, rooms, cells, and passages for gladiators, workers, wild animals, and storage. Today, the structure stands in stark contrast to the modern development that surrounds it and is a prominent reminder
		of ancient times and the extensive history of Rome.

		A gondola ride through the canals of Venice is a 
		tradition that travelers have been enjoying for centuries.
		Venice is a city of islands, and the canals have long
		been the city's main streets, connected by a labyrinth 
		of narrow passageways. Lining the canals are old buildings
		that have remained relatively unchanged for hundreds of years, 
		adding to the romantic charm. The Grand Canal is the most famous of these waterways and one of the most photographed sites in Venice. The best way to see many of the grand palaces, whose fronts face the water, is from a 
		Vaporetto ride along the Grand Canal.

By Air
The Marco Polo Airport is the nearest and the only airport in Venice.
 A 12-kilometre drive from the city, most of the flights that arrive 
 at this airport are from other European cities. The airport is well-connected to the main town by both road and canals. Once you reach here, you can opt for a motorboat ride to the Saint Mark Square (preferred by most of the travellers as you get a sense of the widely used transport mode in Venice). The journey will not take more than an hour and is quite comfortable. However, if you wish to travel by road, then you can board a taxi which can be slightly expensive but is the fastest way to reach the town. You can also board a bus
 from the bus stand outside the terminal.

		The Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually just one of many 
		attractions in the city of Pisa, but its fame, gained from 
		its flaw, is world renown. Work began on the tower in the 1100s,
		and the sinking, which led to the lean, began by the time the tower reached the third story. Prior to restoration work in the 1990s, it was predicted to topple over by the year 2000. Today, visitors can climb up the stairs of the tower for a fabulous view over the city. The Leaning Tower, also known as La Torre Pendente, stands on the Piazza dei Miracoli, a setting it shares with the beautiful Romanesque Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta and a round freestanding baptistery. Each of these features 
		outstanding works of medieval stone carving.

		<h4>Best time to visit: </h4> March-october
		<br/>
		<hr/>
		<h4 >How to reach:</h4> On your own, take the train from
		Florence to Pisa, walk or take a taxi to the Leaning 
		Tower of Pisa, and return to Florence by train. The best
		time to go is in the morning, so you get to the Leaning 
		Tower before the crowds arrive
		<br/>
		<hr/>
		<h4 >Things To Do:</h4> 
		<ul >
		 <li>Climb to the top of the tower. </li>
		 <li>Visit the Duomo and museum</li>
		 <li>CGo inside the Baptistery (Battistero). Begun in 1152, the circular baptistery took several centuries to complete due to periodic lack of funds – mostly when Pisa was at war with neighboring city-states such 
		 as Florence and Siena.</li>
		 <li>Walk around the Camposanto (cemetery). Though it's often overlooked by visitors, the Camposanto, or graveyard, is well worth a visit. </li>

		With the record as Europe's sunniest place, and mile after mile of white sands lapped by gentle seas, it's no wonder that the Costa del Sol beaches are the goal of sun-starved northern Europeans looking for sun-and-sand getaways. This popularity caused serious over-development initially, but the Andalucian government has not only put a stop to this, it has begun the process of tearing down the worst offenders and returning entire sections of coast to natural landscapes, clean beaches, and attractive new buildings that 
		are more in harmony with their surroundings.

Lake Como is one of Italy's most scenic areas, surrounded by 
mountains and lined by small picturesque towns. A haunt of the 
wealthy since Roman times, the lake has many opulent villas and 
palaces along its wooded shores, many of them surrounded by gardens
 that are open to the public. The mild climate that makes the lake shore ideal for gardens is also a draw for tourists, with characteristics similar to that of the Mediterranean. Along with the resort towns 
around the lake, there's an 11th-century abbey.

		<h4>Best time to visit: </h4>March-September

		<h4 >How to reach:</h4> The easiest way to reach Lake Como 
		is via Milan. Catch a train from Milan's central station,
		Milano Centrale, to either Sondrio or Tirano, which leave

		some gaps
