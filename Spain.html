 <h1>Spain</h1>
 <div class="bd">
   <p>Mostly located on the Iberian Peninsula, Spain is the second most
   visited country in Europe.  Around 81.8 million travelers stepped in 
   Spain in 2017 alone, 5 million more than in the previous year.
    <br/>
Spain has 47 UNESCO world heritage sites, numerous beaches on the 
Atlantic and Mediterranean, and numerous festivals that bring together 
people from all across the world. Many have compared the coastal part 
of Spain with tropical islands.
<br/>
The variety of foods, in particular the Tortilla Espanola, Pisto, Paella, Paella and other traditional foods have 
added the value of a trip to Spain.
<br/>
Its football teams are among the most famous in 
the world. It is estimated that the Copa Del Rey championship attracts thousands of visitors yearly.

		The Prado alone ranks with the world's top art museums
		for the riches of its collections. But add the Reina Sofia 
		National Art Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, and the 
		CaixaForum, all along Madrid's mile-long, tree-shaded boulevard, and you have what may be the world's highest concentration of priceless art treasures. It's no wonder this is known as El Paseo del Arte — Boulevard of the Arts.
<br/>
After a 2007 expansion that doubled its exhibition space, the Prado 
added another 12 galleries in 2009 to house a collection of works by 
Goya and other late 19th-century artists. The Prado has the world's largest collection of Spanish art, an impressive continuum from 12th-century medieval works through the avante-garde movement of the early 20th century, and is especially noted for its works from Spain's golden age by El Greco, Velazquez, and Goya.
<br/>
But its riches are not all Spanish; other highlights are the medieval
 murals and retablos, paintings by Flemish and Dutch artists (be sure 
 to see the fantasy world of Hieronymous Bosch and works by Rubens and Brueghel), and Italian art (Botticelli, Raphael, Correggio, Titian, and Tintoretto).
<br/>
Highlights of the Reina Sofia's impressive 20,000 works are Picasso's
 Guernica and works by Miró, Dalí, Dubuffet, Braque, Serra, Calder, 
 and Magritte.

		La Giralda tower, Seville Cathedral, and the Alcazar combine 
		to form a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The tower is a minaret,
		a "masterpiece of Almohad architecture," according to UNESCO. 
		The cathedral has more interior space than St. Peter's in Rome 
		and a 37-meter main altar of carved statues completely covered in gold. The monumental tomb of Christopher Columbus is held aloft by a quartet of larger-than-life figures. La Giralda, the emblem of Seville, began life as a minaret and is all that's left of the city's Great Mosque, destroyed to build the cathedral.
</br>
The Alcazar opposite was begun by the Moors in 712 and continued after 
the Christian re-conquest by King Pedro in the 1300s in the ornate 
neo-Moorish style called Mudejar. The rooms and salons are breathtaking,
 and the gardens a joy to stroll in, shaded by fragrant orange and lemon
 trees. Adjoining on the east is Santa Cruz, the former Juderia (
 Jewish Quarter), a neighborhood of whitewashed homes, iron balconies, and flower-filled courtyards.

		The throbbing heartbeat of Spain's vibrant capital city,
		Plaza Mayor has played an important part in Madrid life 
		since the 16th century, when Philip II entrusted the task 
		of designing it to his favorite architect Juan de Herrera, builder of the Escorial. It has served as the stage for ceremonial events — the proclamation of a new king, the canonization of saints, the burning of heretics — and public entertainment such as chivalric tournaments and bullfights. The cafes reaching out onto its pedestrian-only stone pavement, and the restaurants shaded under its arcades are Madrid's living room, popular meeting places 
		for Madrileños and tourists alike.

		With the record as Europe's sunniest place, and mile after mile of white sands lapped by gentle seas, it's no wonder that the Costa del Sol beaches are the goal of sun-starved northern Europeans looking for sun-and-sand getaways. This popularity caused serious over-development initially, but the Andalucian government has not only put a stop to this, it has begun the process of tearing down the worst offenders and returning entire sections of coast to natural landscapes, clean beaches, and attractive new buildings that 
		are more in harmony with their surroundings.
        <br/>
The beaches are not Costa del Sol's only attraction for tourists. 
Revitalizing its hub city of Málaga has made this coast even more 
alluring to everyone. Yachtsmen love the smart marina of Puerto Banus,
 and avid golfers head west from Marbella's old-world charms to Nueva 
 Andalucia, known as Golf Valley for its more than 50 courses. A few steps from the beach in Marbella is the old town of whitewashed houses and 
well-preserved remains of the Moorish Castillo.
