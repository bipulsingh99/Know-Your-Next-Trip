		Although one of the UK's smaller cities, Bath more than makes up for its diminutive size with a multitude of things to see and do. Named 
		after its famous Roman Baths, this beautiful city has been luring visitors to its healing waters for more than 2,000 years. Gushing from three hot springs, the water-known to consist of 43 different minerals, hence its curative properties-travels upwards some 3,048 meters at a rate of 275,000 gallons per day, before spilling out at a consistent 46.5 degrees Celsius.
<br/>
While it's not possible to bathe in the original Roman Baths, 
a number of nearby spas-most notably the superb Thermae Bath 
Spa-offer guests the chance to enjoy the city's famous waters.
