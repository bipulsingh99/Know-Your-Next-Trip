 <h1>Antarctica</h1>
 <div class="bd">
   <p>There’s a reason people go to such lengths to visit Antarctica, and its abundance of whales, seals, penguins, and other near-limitless seabirds are only part of the polar story. Even if you put its exotically beautiful wildlife aside, Antarctica is undeniably mythic in both scale and scenery: The largest glaciers and icebergs are found there, drawing polar newcomers
   and the certifiably snow-mad alike.

		Penguins and penguin colonies can be found in many places around Antarctica, but there are a few key locations they’re best found. One of the best among them is the emperor penguin colony at Snow Hill Island.

n addition, the Antarctic Peninsula is a great place to spot penguins, especially Adélies, gentoos, and chinstraps. In fact, Adélies only live in Antarctica, unlike other penguin species.More great penguin colonies exist farther north, in the sub-Antarctic islands of South Georgia (another amazing Antarctic attraction we’ll tell you more about later on).

		It’s inarguably lovely to sit on the deck of an ice-strengthened polar vessel or sturdy Zodiac boat and simply watch the procession of glacier fronts, icebergs, and perhaps a few surfacing whales pass your field of vision.
		In a kayak, you can get away from the noise of the motorized vessels and enjoy the scenery in a pure way, powered only by your paddles – i.e., the strength of your own arms.

		If you get the chance to travel the Ross Sea, you are sure to experience one of Antarctica’s finest and least-visited attractions.Pendleton Strait is an occasional landing site that, if sea ice allows it, can afford you a visit to the southern tip of Renaud Island. This Antarctic attraction is home to Adélie penguins as well as dazzling blue-white icebergs.The Amundsen Sea is another major Antarctic attraction we visit during our Ross Sea cruises. There you can find emperor penguins, groups of seals lounging on the ice floes, possible orcas (killer whales) and minke whales spouting along the ice edge, and different species of fulmarine petrels.And then there’s the Ross Ice Shelf, which pretty much speaks for itself.
