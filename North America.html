   <h1 id="header"style="text-align:center;">About North America</h1>
   <p>The third largest continent in the world in terms of landmass and the fourth largest in terms of population, North America, is what we know today as the New World, or simply the Americas. 
   Home to over 500 million people, the continent, is divided into 24 counties, the largest by land mass being Canada and Mexico City by population. Mexico’s Chichen Itza is also one of the seven 
   wonders of the modern world, which belongs to this continent. A global power, United States of America is also one of the most influential countries in the world.</br>

The continent is bounded by the Arctic Ocean to the north, North Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Caribbean Sea on the south, and North Pacific Ocean to the west. North America’s highest point is 
Denali (Mount McKinley), 6,190 meters above the sea level and Death Valley in California is the lowest being 86 meters below the sea level.</br>

America is named after Amerigo Vespucci, who was the first to explain that Columbus’ journey was not to India, but to an entirely 
different landmass. The natives of this continent are believed to be North East Asian, who were also the first to settle on the Earth, even before the Europeans.</br>

The United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Bahamas, and Costa Rica are the prominently visited countries of North America. Living on the edge, a fast-paced 
and relatively free-spirited life, the people belonging to this region lend a welcoming and warm vibe to this land. With compact diversity, three languages- English, 
Spanish, and French- prominently rule the continent.</br>

Endowed with natural resources- ample fresh water resources, thick forests, great mineral wealth, and vast lands of fertile soil, North America is counted as one of 
the most economically developed regions in the world. It may interest you to know the average per capita income and food consumption of a single individual in North America
 is significantly higher than any other continent in the region.</br>
