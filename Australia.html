   <h1 id="header"style="text-align:center;">About Australia</h1>
   <p>New Zealand and Australia are both part of the Oceanian sub-region known as Australasia, with New Guinea being in Melanesia.

The term Oceania, originally a "great division" of the world,
 was replaced by the concept of Australia as a continent in the 1950s.
Today, the term Oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing
 the Australian continent, Zealandia and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in 
the seven-continent model.</br>
